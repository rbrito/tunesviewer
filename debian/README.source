Debian packaging for tunesviewer
-------------------------------

A quick summary of how one can update the Debian packaging of tunesviewer is
to, assuming that one already has the packages `devscripts`,
`git-buildpackage`, and `pristine-tar` installed:

    gbp-clone --all git://github.com/rbrito/tunesviewer.git
    cd tunesviewer
    git checkout -- debian
    [ Make here some adaptations, like updating debian/changelog, if needed ]
    git-buildpackage

These are the important steps and may need to be changed according to
deviations, say, in the release process of tunesviewer.
