# TunesViewer

TunesViewer is a small, easy to use program to access iTunes-university
media and podcasts in Linux.

## Features:

* Direct searching, browsing, and downloading.
* Supports itunes-University login, to download students-and-staff-only
  media.
* Reveals the standard rss-podcast-feed of the itunes-podcasts, for use in
  any podcast software.
* Includes the option to set itself as default protocol handler, to go
  directly from the "loading itunes-U..." page to viewing with TunesViewer.

## Non-Features:

* Automatic podcast updates, auto-downloads and transfers: this program
  isn't a general-purpose podcast manager, but it can add podcasts to
  rhythmbox/gpodder/amarok/etc.
* iTunes Store: this will not let you connect to iTunes store accounts or
  buy anything.

## Minimum System Requirements:

Tunesviewer works well even on older computers, but you *must* have
`pygtk` >= 2.16 and `lxml` available. This shouldn't be a problem for
recent versions of Ubuntu, Fedora etc., as these prerequisites should be
taken care of automatically by package managers. Unfortunately the current
Tunesviewer 2.0 does not run on Ubuntu 17.10 and similar systems due to 
WebKit packaging. A new version with WebKit2 is in the research phase.
    
## Installation:

1.  Download the install package: ([.deb installer][0] for Ubuntu/Debian
    based operating systems, [.rpm installer][1] for Fedora/Red Hat based
    operating systems).

2.  Open the package and it should install. After installing, you should see
    TunesViewer on your Applications - Internet menu.

3.  Important post-installation setup: Go to TunesViewer preferences (in the
    Edit menu), and select the download-folder. Choose the folder you want
    to download to. If you select your rhythmbox/amarok library directory
    they should automatically add to your library.

The main [project of TunesViewer][2] is hosted on [SourceForge.net][3].

## Running from Git Checkout

After checking out the latest master (or other branch), double click and run src/Tunesviewer.py.

## Building a Debian Package

Building a Debian Package from the git repository, ready for installation in
your system is as easy as:

1. Installing the packages `build-essential`, `debhelper`, `fakeroot`, and `python`
2. Checking out the `debian` branch of this project (and optionally merging in other branch)
3. Typing `fakeroot debian/rules clean binary`

If you encounter problems, make sure debian/rules and the python files in src/ are executable.

## Experimental Debian Packages

Moderately recent and ready-to-install packages for Debian-based systems
(like Ubuntu, Linux mint and others) taken from this development tree are
provided in [Rog√©rio Theodoro de Brito's PPA][4].

You are welcome to install them and to report potential issues with respect
to the packaging in this [project's issue tracker][5].
